## Small Story
It was originally planned to creat a customized installer iso file with everything preconfigured.
However in the course of doing that I learned a very valuable thing.
Live Boot ISO, as in the kind that you load onto a USB and then that USB have everything you need to run the system from that USB can be customized to your heart content.
However, Installer ISO files you can only change which packages you choose to install by default.
In spite of that limitations that seeked to make my job harder I decided to do the next best thing create a post install script to configured the systems after the base install.
